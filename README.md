This project implements a robust Face Detection and Recognition System with two models:

Face Detection Model: Identifies and localizes human faces in images and video streams.

Face Recognition & TTS Model: Detects, recognizes known faces, and uses Text-to-Speech (TTS) to announce the detected person's identity.

This system is optimized for real-time performance and can be integrated into assistive applications for visually impaired individuals or security systems.
